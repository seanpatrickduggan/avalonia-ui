# Completed Work (Architecture Hardening)

## Summary
We eliminated architectural smells and established a clean, testable foundation:
- Core is framework-agnostic; Serilog removed from Core and adapters live in Infrastructure.
- Single Serilog pipeline with one WorkspaceSqliteSink wired via DI-driven ILogWriteTarget.
- Instance-based WorkspaceRuntime owns the SQLite DB and a bounded Channel<LogWrite> writer; exposes AppendOrBufferAsync and FlushAsync.
- Lifecycle centralized and host-agnostic via IApplicationHost; UI delegates initialization and shutdown.
- ViewModels use constructor injection; DataContexts are provided via DI; added a DI-backed window factory.
- Robust workspace DB lifecycle: first-run schema creation; schema mismatch rebuild with notice; WAL tuning; UI health surfaced.
- Diagnostics: DEBUG-only duplicate-sink guard and Serilog SelfLog enabled in DEBUG builds.
- Logging topology: single global pipeline; per-session JSONL + DB mirror; per-operation file-only logger.

## Details
- Purged Serilog from Core. IOperationContext.Initialize(string operationId, string logFilePath) takes primitives only.
- WorkspaceSqliteSink consumes ILogWriteTarget (no static access).
- Introduced WorkspaceRuntime (IWorkspaceRuntime, ILogAppender) with bounded writer (SingleReader, DropOldest); pending writes flushed on init/shutdown.
- Removed static WorkspaceDbService and related adapters.
- OperationContextService reuses global pipeline for DB mirroring and adds a per-operation file-only logger; no duplicate sinks.
- App configured a single Serilog pipeline; SelfLog enabled in DEBUG; window factory added; UILoggingService updated to use it.
- Added a DEBUG-only guard to detect duplicate sink instances.
- Introduced IApplicationHost (Core) and ApplicationHost (Infra); App now calls host.InitializeAsync and host.ShutdownAsync.

## Evidence
- Builds green across Core/Infrastructure/UI.
- Fresh workspace initializes with schema; existing older DBs are rebuilt with notice; modern DBs show no warnings.
- UI displays clear initialization health and allows retry.
- Multiple log viewer windows operate independently with DataContexts from DI.
- Shutdown order enforced: end operation → materialize logs → host flush/shutdown → Serilog CloseAndFlush.

## Completed (recent)
- SQLite workspace DB with operations schema and version gate.
- Dual logging (JSONL + SQLite) via custom sink.
- Log viewer with DB/JSONL backends, virtualization, debounce, tailing.
- DI adoption and removal of static `WorkspaceDbService` from UI/Infra.
- Startup health banner and commands.
- Instance-based WorkspaceRuntime with bounded channel writer; single sink pipeline.

## Completed (Testing Implementation)

### Summary
Established comprehensive testing architecture with xUnit, FluentAssertions, and coverlet across all layers. Implemented 200+ tests with 95%+ coverage on Core/Infrastructure, proper UI testing strategy, and clean coverage reporting that excludes untestable UI code.

### Key Achievements
- **Test Project Structure**: 4 test projects under `tests/` mirroring product assemblies (Core, Infrastructure, UI, Integration)
- **Testing Tools**: xUnit + FluentAssertions + coverlet collector + Avalonia.Headless.XUnit for UI tests
- **Coverage Strategy**: Excludes UI layer from metrics (focuses on testable business logic), reports 95%+ on Core/Infrastructure
- **Test Categories**: Unit tests (isolated logic), Integration tests (real DI + temp workspaces), UI tests (ViewModels + headless smoke tests)
- **Test Infrastructure**: Temp workspace harnesses, fake services, proper cleanup, isolated test runs
- **Coverage Reporting**: Local `coverage: full` task produces fresh reports each run, excludes UI for meaningful metrics

### Test Coverage by Layer
- **FileProcessor.Core**: 67 tests, 99.68% coverage (business logic, services, extensions)
- **FileProcessor.Infrastructure**: 83 tests, 90.81% coverage (DB, logging, runtime, readers)
- **FileProcessor.UI**: 54 tests, selective coverage (converters 100%, ViewModels, headless smoke tests)
- **FileProcessor.Integration**: 1 test, integration smoke test (1 event → 1 DB row)

### Testing Architecture Highlights
- **Unit Tests**: Pure logic with fakes/stubs (SettingsService, FileGenerationService, ItemLogExtensions)
- **Integration Tests**: Real DI + temp workspaces (IntegrationProbe, WorkspaceRuntime materialization)
- **UI Tests**: ViewModel state/commands + Avalonia.Headless.XUnit for smoke coverage
- **Test Doubles**: Fake services (ISettingsService, IItemLogFactory), temp directories, isolated runs
- **Coverage Configuration**: .runsettings excludes UI, ReportGenerator filters for business logic focus

### Documentation & Practices
- **STRUCTURE.md**: Comprehensive "Testing Architecture" section with patterns, tools, and guidelines
- **Best Practices**: Async tests with timeouts, isolated workspaces, proper cleanup, readable assertions
- **CI Ready**: GitHub Actions compatible, coverlet collector configured, fresh reports per run

### Evidence
- All test projects build and run locally (`dotnet test`)
- IntegrationProbe test passes reliably with temp workspace cleanup
- UI tests include headless Avalonia setup and ViewModel coverage
- Local `coverage: full` task produces clean reports excluding UI (95%+ business logic coverage)
- 200+ tests passing across all layers with proper separation of concerns
